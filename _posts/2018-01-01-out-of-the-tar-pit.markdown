Complexity is the single major difficulty in the successful development of
large-scale software systems. Following Brooks we distinguish accidental from
essential difficulty, but disagree with his premise that most complexity
remaining in contemporary systems is essential. We identify common causes of
complexity and discuss general approaches which can be taken to eliminate them
where they are accidental in nature. To make things more concrete we then give
an outline for a potential complexity-minimizing approach based on functional
programming and Codd’s relational model of data.
