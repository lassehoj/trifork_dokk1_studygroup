In this post I present the development model that I’ve introduced for some of
my projects (both at work and private) about a year ago, and which has turned
out to be very successful. I’ve been meaning to write about it for a while now,
but I’ve never really found the time to do so thoroughly, until now. I won’t
talk about any of the projects’ details, merely about the branching strategy
and release management.
