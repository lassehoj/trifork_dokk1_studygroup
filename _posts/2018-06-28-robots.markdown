*Abstract*
Many web hosts are still vulnerable to one of the oldest attacks against RSA in
TLS. We show that Bleichenbacher’s RSA vulnerability from 1998 is still very
prevalent in the Internet and affects almost a third of the top 100
domains in the Alexa Top 1 Million list, among them Facebook and Paypal. We
identified vulnerable products from at least eight differ- ent vendors and open
source projects, among them F5, Citrix, Radware, Cisco, Erlang, Bouncy
Castle, and WolfSSL. Further we have demon- strated practical
exploitation by signing a message with the private key of facebook.com’s HTTPS
certificate. Finally, we discuss countermeasures against Bleichenbacher
attacks in TLS and recommend to deprecate the RSA encryption key exchange in
TLS and the PKCS #1 v1.5 standard.
