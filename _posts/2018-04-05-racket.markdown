*Abstract:*
In the ideal world, software developers would analyze each problem in the
language of its domain and then articulate solutions in matching terms. They
could thus easily communicate with domain experts and separate problem-specific
ideas from the details of general-purpose languages and specific program design
decisions.

In the real world, however, programmers use a mainstream programming language
someone else picked for them. To address this conflict, they resort to—and on
occasion build their own—domain-specific languages embedded in the chosen
language (embedded domain-specific languages, or eDSLs). For example,
JavaScript programmers employ jQuery for interacting with the Document Object
Model and React for dealing with events and concurrency. As developers solve
their problems in appropriate eDSLs, they compose these solutions into one
system; that is, they effectively write multilingual software in a common host
language.
