*Abstract:*

Systems that operate in purely statistical mode of inference entail theoretical
limits on their power and performance. Such systems cannot reason about
interventions and retrospection and, therefore, cannot serve as the basis for
strong AI. To achieve human-level intelligence, learning machines need the
guidance of a model of external reality, similar to the ones used in causal
inference tasks. To demonstrate the essential role of such models, this paper
presents a summary of seven tasks which are beyond reach of associational
learning systems and which have been accomplished using the tools of
causal modeling.
